I thought your research was incredibly interesting and well-researched. I thought your research was well-thought-out and your decisions were clearly justified. I can't wait to see your final presentation. I love the carry trade idea.

Start on VAEs early because it might be hard to implement."
Nice presentation! The introduction was great. I was not familiar with the topics you presented on but felt I could follow based on your descriptions. Great presentation skills as well.
