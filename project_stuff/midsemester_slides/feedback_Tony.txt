The diagrams in your introduction were helpful in understanding your data and aims. Not too familiar with the topic but looking forward to seeing the results.
The background was really helpful! It was a super interesting question and the approach was fascinating. I'm looking forward to seeing the final results.
I thought it was the best presentation the world has ever seen.
I think your presentation is incredibly interesting and I think your approach is novel and well-justified. I can't wait to see your final presentation!
"Positive praise:

Your idea is really strong and well-thought out, and I think it is well poised for Bayesian analysis. You've done a lot of preliminary analyses and it's clear you've put in a lot of work towards this project.

Feedback:

Maybe do a park-by-park analysis? Or regional analysis?"
