The background and motivation was super thorough and really interesting. I'm excited to learn more during the final presentation.
I think the presentation was very informative. I think Ariana would benefit from speaking a bit louder when presenting. The tempo is also a bit slow, and I believe Ariana could benefit from speaking slightly faster.
I liked how you provided relevant background information and visuals to motivate your research. I think your research is very topical, and I think phishing could be the basis for an incredibly interesting paper.Â

Feedback:

More thorough Bayesian analysis => maybe also use different types of models."
